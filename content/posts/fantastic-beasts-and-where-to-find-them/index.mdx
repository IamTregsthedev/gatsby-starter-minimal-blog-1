Hey Everyone!

Arav here! I decided to make my own Blog, to share my thoughts and Ideas. I love writing, though I miss just writing for myself, and people. Which is why, I made this blog. There's No Analytics, no stats,  just me writing, and having fun. 

I've decided to write the first post today, you can check it out. It's called Fixing my Twitter Feed, and Why!


import React from "react";

const Blog = ({ posts }: PostsProps) => {
  const { tagsPath, basePath } = useSiteMetadata();

  return (
    <Layout>
      <Flex sx={{ alignItems: `center`, justifyContent: `space-between` }}>
        <Heading variant="h2" as="h2">
          Blog
        </Heading>
        <Styled.a
          as={Link}
          sx={{ variant: `links.secondary` }}
          to={`/${basePath}/${tagsPath}`.replace(/\/\/+/g, `/`)}
        >
          View all tags
        </Styled.a>
      </Flex>
      <Listing posts={posts} sx={{ mt: [4, 5] }} />
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default Blog;
